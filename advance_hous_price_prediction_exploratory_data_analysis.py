#Aim of this project is to predict the house price based on various features.
#Life cycle of datascience project:
#1.Data Analysis
#2.Feature Engineering
#3.Feature selection
#4.Model building
#5.Model deployment

#Data Analysis phase:
#Understanding more about the data:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

#To display all the columns of dataframe:
pd.set_option('display.max_columns',None)
dataset=pd.read_csv(r'E:\ml\python\train.csv')
dataset.shape
dataset.head()
#In Data Analysis we will analyse to find out following things:
#1.Missing Data
#2.All the numerical veriables
#3.Distribution of Numerical variables
#4.Categorical variables
#5.Cardinality of categorical variables
#6.Outliers
#7.Relationship between independent and dependent feautre (SalePrice)

#Missing Values:
#here percentage of nan values missing in each feature is determined:
#step-1:make a list of features which has missing values:
features_with_na=[features for features in dataset.columns if dataset[features].isnull().sum()>1]
#step-2:Print feature name and mean of missing values present in each feature:
for feature in features_with_na:
    print(feature,np.round(dataset[feature].isnull().mean(),4))

#since there are many missing values, we need to find relationship between missing values and SalesPrice
#Plotting diagram for this relationship:
    for feature in features_with_na:
        data=dataset.copy()
        
    #Let's make a variable that indicates 1 if the observation was missing or zero for observation not missing
        data[feature]=np.where(data[feature].isnull(),1,0) 
        
    #Let's calculate mean of Saleprice where information is missing :
        data.groupby(feature)['SalePrice'].median().plot.bar() #names of columns we want to group on are passed to groupby() function follwed by column on which we want to perform aggreagation or other functionality.
        
        plt.title(feature)
        plt.show()       
#Relation between Missing values and dependent variable is clearly visible i.e for some features mean of SalePrice has highest value for its missing values and some features have highest mean of Saleprice for its non-missing values.
#We need to replace these Missing values(nan) with some meaningful values which is done in Feature Engineering.
